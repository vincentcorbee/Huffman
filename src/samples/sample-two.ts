export const sampleTwo = `You should call this method whenever you're ready to update your animation onscreen. This will request that your animation function be called before the browser performs the next repaint. The number of callbacks is usually 60 times per second, but will generally match the display refresh rate in most web browsers as per W3C recommendation. requestAnimationFrame() calls are paused in most browsers when running in background tabs or hidden <iframe>s in order to improve performance and battery life.

The callback method is passed a single argument, a DOMHighResTimeStamp, which indicates the current time (based on the number of milliseconds since time origin). When multiple callbacks queued by requestAnimationFrame() begin to fire in a single frame, each receives the same timestamp even though time has passed during the computation of every previous callback's workload (in the code example below we only animate the frame when the timestamp changes, i.e. on the first callback). This timestamp is a decimal number, in milliseconds, but with a minimal precision of 1ms (1000 Âµs).`
